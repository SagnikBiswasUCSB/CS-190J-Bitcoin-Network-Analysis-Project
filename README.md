# CS190J Bitcoin Project: Unveiling Market Structures through Advanced Network Analysis, Temporal Dynamics, and Topological Signatures

**Authors:** Pratyush Rallapally, Matthew Zhang, Rishik Buneti, Sagnik Biswas

## Project Overview

This project investigates advanced network analysis techniques to identify and characterize meaningful community structures within Bitcoin trust-based ecosystems. Traditional methods often struggle with the complex interplay of signed relationships, crucial higher-order interactions, and the vital **temporal dynamics** inherent in these networks. This research aims to:

1.  Systematically evaluate and apply methodologies including:
    * Nuanced signed modularity.
    * Spectral analysis via Hodge Laplacians (L0, L1, L2) to capture multi-way interactions and topological holes.
    * Persistent Homology (Topological Data Analysis - TDA), with a strong emphasis on **time-based filtrations (using edge timestamps as the filtration parameter $\epsilon$)** alongside attribute-based filtrations, to identify stable and evolving topological features.
2.  Apply these techniques to real-world Bitcoin user rating datasets (Bitcoin OTC and Bitcoin Alpha), which contain rich timestamped interaction data.
3.  Decode the fundamental "operational blueprints" and "topological fingerprints" of hidden or implicit communities, particularly focusing on their **temporal behavior and evolution**.
4.  Pinpoint which advanced methodologies, especially those leveraging temporal information, offer the clearest and most actionable insights for understanding these complex digital economies.

The goal is to move beyond static, surface-level clustering to reveal persistent and evolving structural patterns that characterize different market actors and their operations over time.

## Repository Structure
* `script.py`: The main Python script for data loading, preprocessing, analysis algorithms (including temporal analysis setups), and visualization.
* `soc-sign-bitcoinotc.csv.gz`: Compressed CSV data for the Bitcoin OTC trust network (timestamped).
* `soc-sign-bitcoinalpha.csv.gz`: Compressed CSV data for the Bitcoin Alpha trust network (timestamped).
* `bitcoin_project_outputs/` (or similar, generated by `script.py`): Directory where plots (including time-evolution related visualizations if generated) and other output files are saved.
* (Potentially) `CS190J_Bitcoin_Research_Paper.pdf`: The final research paper.

## Datasets
This project utilizes two timestamped datasets from SNAP:
1.  **Bitcoin OTC trust weighted signed network (`soc-sign-bitcoinotc.csv.gz`)**
    * Source: [https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoinotc.html](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoinotc.html)
2.  **Bitcoin Alpha trust weighted signed network (`soc-sign-bitcoinalpha.csv.gz`)**
    * Source: [https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoinalpha.html](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoinalpha.html)

**Download these `.csv.gz` files and place them in the script's directory or update paths. The script can read `.gz` files directly.**

## Methodology Explored
The `script.py` implements or provides a framework for:
* **Community Detection:** Louvain Modularity, Girvan-Newman, k-Clique Percolation.
* **Spectral Methods & Hodge Laplacians:** $L_0$, $L_1$, $L_2$ analysis.
* **Topological Data Analysis (TDA - Conceptual Setup):**
    * Framework for creating filtrations based on edge weights (trust/distrust) and **prominently, edge timestamps (time $t$ as $\epsilon$) to analyze network evolution via persistent homology.**
    * Conceptual generation of persistence barcodes (H0, H1) to identify stable/evolving components and cycles. (Full TDA requires specialized libraries like GUDHI).
* **Temporal Analysis:**
    * Direct use of timestamps in TDA filtrations.
    * Functions for creating network snapshots (time windows) for dynamic analysis with any of the above methods.
