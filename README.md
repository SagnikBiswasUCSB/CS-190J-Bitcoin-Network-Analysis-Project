# CS190J Bitcoin Project: Unveiling Market Structures through Advanced Network Analysis, Temporal Dynamics, and Topological Signatures

**Authors:** Pratyush Rallapally, Matthew Zhang, Rishik Buneti, Sagnik Biswas

## Project Overview

This project investigates advanced network analysis techniques to identify and characterize meaningful community structures within Bitcoin trust-based ecosystems. Traditional methods often struggle with the complex interplay of signed relationships, crucial higher-order interactions, and the vital **temporal dynamics** inherent in these networks. This research aims to:

1.  Systematically evaluate and apply methodologies including:
    * Nuanced signed modularity (conceptually).
    * Spectral analysis via Graph ($L_0$) and Hodge Laplacians ($L_1$, $L_2$ components) to capture multi-way interactions and topological features.
    * Simulated Topological Data Analysis (TDA), with a strong emphasis on **time-based filtrations (using edge timestamps)** alongside attribute-based filtrations, to illustrate the identification of evolving topological features (components, cycles).
2.  Apply these techniques to real-world Bitcoin user rating datasets (Bitcoin OTC and Bitcoin Alpha), which contain rich timestamped interaction data.
3.  Decode the fundamental "operational blueprints" and "topological fingerprints" of hidden or implicit communities, particularly focusing on their **temporal behavior and evolution**.
4.  Pinpoint which advanced methodologies, especially those leveraging temporal information, offer the clearest insights for understanding these complex digital economies.

The goal is to move beyond static, surface-level clustering to reveal persistent and evolving structural patterns that characterize different market actors and their operations over time.

## Repository Structure

* `script.py`: The main Python script for data loading, preprocessing, analysis algorithms (including temporal analysis setups), and visualization.
* `soc-sign-bitcoinotc.csv.gz`: Compressed CSV data for the Bitcoin OTC trust network (timestamped).
* `soc-sign-bitcoinalpha.csv.gz`: Compressed CSV data for the Bitcoin Alpha trust network (timestamped).
* `Bitcoin_Project_Analysis_Outputs/` (generated by `script.py`): Directory where plots and other output files from the analyses will be saved.
* (Potentially) `CS190J_Bitcoin_Research_Paper.pdf`: The final research paper.

## Datasets

This project utilizes two timestamped datasets from the Stanford Network Analysis Platform (SNAP):

1.  **Bitcoin OTC trust weighted signed network (`soc-sign-bitcoinotc.csv.gz`)**
    * Source: [https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoinotc.html](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoinotc.html)
2.  **Bitcoin Alpha trust weighted signed network (`soc-sign-bitcoinalpha.csv.gz`)**
    * Source: [https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoinalpha.html](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoinalpha.html)

**Download these `.csv.gz` files and place them in the script's directory or update paths. The script reads `.gz` files directly.**

## Methodology Implemented/Simulated

The `script.py` implements or simulates the following analyses:

* **Community Detection:**
    * Louvain Modularity optimization.
    * Girvan-Newman divisive clustering (on smaller graphs/subgraphs).
    * k-Clique Percolation for overlapping communities.
* **Spectral Methods & Hodge Laplacians:**
    * $L_0$ (Graph Laplacian): Fiedler vector partitioning, top-k eigenvector clustering.
    * $B_1$ (node-to-edge) and $B_2$ (edge-to-triangle, structural) incidence matrices.
    * $L_1^{\text{down}}$, $L_1^{\text{up}}$, $L_1^{\text{full}}$, and $L_2^{\text{down}}$ Hodge Laplacian components and their spectral properties.
* **Simulated Topological Data Analysis (TDA):**
    * Framework for creating filtrations based on edge weights (trust/distrust) and **edge timestamps (time $t$ as $\epsilon$)**.
    * **Illustrative generation of persistence barcodes (H0, H1)** based on the evolution of connected components and potential cycles in graph snapshots. This simulates the *type* of output expected from a full TDA library.
* **Temporal Analysis:**
    * Direct use of timestamps in the simulated TDA filtrations.
    * Functions for creating network snapshots for dynamic analysis with other methods.

## Running the Analysis

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* Required Python packages:
    * `pandas`
    * `networkx`
    * `numpy`
    * `scipy`
    * `matplotlib`
    * `python-louvain`

    You can install these using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas networkx numpy scipy matplotlib python-louvain
    ```

### Execution

1.  **Ensure Data Files:** Place `soc-sign-bitcoinotc.csv.gz` and `soc-sign-bitcoinalpha.csv.gz` in the root directory of the repository, or update paths in `script.py`.
2.  **Run Script:** Execute the main script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python script.py
    ```
3.  **Outputs:** The script will print analysis progress to the console and save generated plots and any other specified outputs to a directory (default: `Bitcoin_Project_Analysis_Outputs_Complete/`).

## Important Note on Advanced Methods

While this script provides a comprehensive framework:
* **Hodge Laplacians:** The $B_2$ construction and subsequent $L_1^{\text{up}}$ and $L_2^{\text{down}}$ are based on structural identification of 3-cliques. Rigorous algebraic topology (e.g., consistent global orientation of all simplices) is complex and typically handled by specialized libraries for full mathematical guarantees.
* **Topological Data Analysis (TDA):** The persistent homology barcodes generated by this script are **illustrative simulations** based on graph component evolution. True persistent homology computation requires dedicated algorithms and libraries (e.g., GUDHI, Ripser, Dionysus) that operate on filtered simplicial complexes. This script sets up the conceptual data for such filtrations but does not perform the actual PH computation.

The aim is to provide a runnable "one-for-all" script that explores these concepts as deeply as feasible with standard scientific Python packages.
